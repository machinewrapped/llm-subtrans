# Multi-Format Subtitle Support Implementation Proposal

**Note** tests MUST be invoked via `python tests/unit_tests.py` to bootstrap the test environment.

## Executive Summary

This document captures the architecture and decisions behind LLM-Subtrans's multi-format subtitle support through Phase 7 and outlines the remaining work. The system now uses a format-agnostic approach with pluggable file handlers that auto-register based on file extensions.

## Current State After Phase 7

### Existing Architecture
- **Core Internal Representation**: `SubtitleLine` objects with timing, text, and metadata
- **File Format Handling**: `SubtitleFormatRegistry` discovers handlers such as `SrtFileHandler` and `SSAFileHandler`
- **Integration Points**: `SubtitleProject` reads and writes `Subtitles` files by extension
- **Serialization**: `SubtitleSerialisation.py` handles project file persistence
- **Interface**: Abstract `SubtitleFileHandler` defines parsing and composing operations

### Current Limitations
- SRT, SSA/ASS, and WebVTT formats implemented
- Content-based format detection now implemented via `pysubs2`

## Architecture Overview

### Responsibility Separation
**SubtitleProject** becomes responsible for:
- Format detection and handler selection via `SubtitleFormatRegistry`
- Orchestrating format conversions by creating new `Subtitles` instances
- Coordinating file I/O operations with appropriate handlers

**Subtitles** becomes format-agnostic by:
- Determining the appropriate `file_handler` to use based on filename
- Focusing purely on subtitle data management and business logic
- No format-specific code or assumptions

### Format Detection & Routing System
The `SubtitleFormatRegistry`:
- Auto-discovers handlers in `PySubtitle/Formats/` directory
- Maps file extensions to appropriate handlers using priority values
- Can auto-detect format based on content
- Supports disabling auto-discovery for controlled test environments

### Handler Auto-Discovery
- Handler classes in `PySubtitle/Formats/*.py` that inherit from `SubtitleFileHandler` are automatically registered
- Registration is driven by each handler's `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` class variable
- Higher priority handlers override lower priority ones

### Core Use Case Focus
The implementation prioritizes **subtitle translation** over format conversion:
- Primary workflow: Load subtitles → Translate → Save (same format)
- Being able to save as a different format is a secondary benefit

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Format Registry Foundation
**Requirements**:
- Create `SubtitleFormatRegistry` class
- Implement auto-discovery mechanism for handlers
- Add format detection by file extension
- Create unit tests for registry functionality

**Acceptance Tests**:
- [x] Registry discovers existing `SrtFileHandler` automatically
- [x] Registry maps `.srt` extension to `SrtFileHandler`
- [x] Registry raises appropriate errors for unknown extensions
- [x] Registry can enumerate all available formats
- [x] Registry handles duplicate extension registration with priority

**Files to Modify**:
- Create: `PySubtitle/SubtitleFormatRegistry.py`
- Create: `PySubtitle/UnitTests/test_SubtitleFormatRegistry.py`

### Phase 2: Integration with SubtitleProject and Subtitles
**Requirements**:
- Modify `Subtitles.__init__()` to require `file_handler` parameter
- Update `SubtitleProject` to handle format detection and handler selection
- Implement format conversion logic in `SubtitleProject`
- Maintain backward compatibility through `SubtitleProject`

**Acceptance Tests**:
 - [x] Existing SRT files continue to load without changes via `SubtitleProject`
 - [x] `SubtitleProject` detects format automatically by file extension
 - [x] All existing unit tests continue to pass
 - [x] Project files instantiate appropriate file handler when loading project

**Files to Modify**:
- `PySubtitle/Subtitles.py`: Require `file_handler` parameter, remove hardcoded SRT handler
- `PySubtitle/SubtitleProject.py`: Add format detection, handler selection, conversion logic

### Phase 3: SSA/ASS Format Support [X] COMPLETED
**Requirements**:
- [X] Implement `SSAFileHandler` class supporting Advanced SubStation Alpha format
- [X] Handle SSA-specific features: styles, positioning, effects, colors
- [X] Store SSA-specific data in `SubtitleLine.metadata`
- [X] Support both reading and writing SSA format
- [X] Maintain index uniqueness for dialogue events

**Priority System Implementation**:
- [x] Implemented data-driven `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` class variable architecture
- [x] Priority convention established: 10 (specialist) > 5 (secondary) > 0 (fallback)
- [x] Base class methods `get_file_extensions()` and `get_extension_priorities()` auto-implement from class data
- [x] Registry supports `disable_autodiscovery()` for precise test control

**Acceptance Tests**:
- [X] Parse basic SSA files with dialogue events
- [X] Preserve style information in metadata
- [X] Handle multi-line dialogue correctly
- [X] Export to SSA format maintaining original styling
- [X] Assign unique indices to all dialogue events
- [X] Handle SSA timing format conversion
- [X] Support V4+ Styles and V4 Styles sections
- [x] `SrtFileHandler` (priority 10) maintains highest priority for .srt files

**Files Created**:
- [X] `PySubtitle/Formats/SSAFileHandler.py` (pysubs2-based implementation)
- [X] `PySubtitle/UnitTests/test_SSAFileHandler.py`

**Implementation Outcome**:
The project standardised on a pysubs2-based `SSAFileHandler`, which provides full metadata preservation and round-trip fidelity. Early custom efforts were discarded in favour of the library-backed approach.

**pysubs2 Library Evaluation**:
After implementation comparison, `pysubs2` was identified as the superior approach for most formats:
- **Battle-tested**: Used by video editing professionals
- **Comprehensive**: Supports SSA, WebVTT, TTML, MicroDVD, MPL2, SAMI, TMP, Whisper formats
- **Perfect fidelity**: Complete metadata preservation with round-trip accuracy
- **Professional quality**: Proper format structure and compliance
- **Future-proof**: Automatic updates as library evolves

### Phase 4: Format conversion

We provide the option to read from one format and write to another as a convenience, but the focus of the application is translation of existing subtitles, format conversion is not a core feature (it is best handled by dedicated tools).

### Conversion process
- Source format is autodetected based on the input filename
- Output format is assumed to be the same, by default, but will be autodetected from the output filename if specified
- Content and metadata are passed through and interpreted by the `SubtitleFileHandler` selected for the output format
- `SubtitleFileHandler` can extend or update metadata if necessary

### CLI Support
The user is already able to specify an output path with `-o` or `--output`, so automatic determination of the file handler to use based on the output path is straightforward.

### GUI Support
Currently the user has no control over the output path for translated subtitles, they are saved in the same directory as the `.subtrans` project file with an auto-generated filename based on the project filename, the target language and the extension of the **source** subtitles. 

We will need to add a "format" field to new project settings to allow the user to specify a different format. It should be a drop-down, whose values are auto-populated from the extensions registered with `SubtitleFormatRegistry`. The default value is be deduced from the sourcepath when subtitles are loaded.

**Requirements**
- Destination format auto-detected from output file extensions
- `SubtitleProject.SaveTranslation` calls appropriate handlers for the output format
- Handlers preserve or translate metadata as needed for the target format, passing through any fields they do not use.
- Update open file filters to show all supported formats + `.subtrans` projects
- Supported formats are determined from the registered handlers in `SubtitleFormatRegistry`

**Acceptance Tests**
- [X] Load .srt file and save as .srt without errors
- [X] Load .ass file and save as .ass without errors
- [X] Load .ass subtitle file and save as .srt without errors
- [X] Load .srt subtitle file and save as .ass without errors
- [X] Load `SubtitleProject` with converted formats without errors
- [X] Load legacy `SubtitleProject` without errors
- [X] Format auto-detection from specified output path via CLI
- [X] File open dialogs show all supported formats + `.subtrans` projects

### Phase 5: Documentation and CLI Updates
**Requirements**:
- Add format listing command to CLI
- Update documentation with supported formats
- Create format-specific usage examples
- Update help text and error messages
- Update architecture.md with details of the SubtitleFormatRegistry and SubtitleFileHandler
- Review architecture.md and readme.md in full to ensure they are current and correct

**Files to Modify**:
- CLI argument parsing (subtrans_common.py)
- Documentation (readme.md, architecture.md)

**Acceptance Tests**:
- [X] CLI can list supported formats (e.g., `--list-formats`)
- [X] Help documentation includes format information
- [X] Error messages specify available formats
- [X] Examples provided for each supported format

**Implementation Outcome**:
Phase 5 adds a `--list-formats` option to all CLI tools, documents supported extensions, and improves error messages with available format hints. The architecture documentation now explains the `SubtitleFormatRegistry` and `SubtitleFileHandler` components, and README examples demonstrate format-specific usage and conversion.

### Phase 6: Enhanced Format Detection

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** `pysubs2` supports format detection from content. We should aim to leverage that rather than implement our own detection logic.

**Requirements**:
- [x] Support format detection when file extension is missing/incorrect
- [x] Report detected_format via `SubtitleData` and automatically update the project output format
- [x] Project format and file extension determined by output_path > detected_format > source_path > default (srt) priority order
- [x] Error reporting for format detection failures

**Acceptance Tests**:
- [x] Detect SRT format with .txt extension
- [x] Detect SSA format with .txt extension
- [x] Detect SSA format with .ass extension
- [x] Provide clear error messages for undetectable formats
- [x] Handle edge cases with malformed files gracefully

**Implementation Notes**:
- Leveraged `pysubs2.fileio.detect_format` for content-based detection.
- `SubtitleData` now carries a `detected_format` field consumed by `Subtitles` to select default output extensions.
- CLI `--output` parameters still override auto-detected paths; GUI defaults can be overridden in `NewProjectSettings`.

**Files to Modify**:
- `PySubtitle/SubtitleFormatRegistry.py`: Add format detection hooks
- `PySubtitle/SubtitleFileHandler.py` and subclasses: Add detection methods if necessary

### Phase 7: WebVTT Format Support [X] COMPLETED
Universal web standard, supported by all major platforms, proof of concept for native handlers

**Requirements**:
- [X] Keep existing `SrtFileHandler` (well-tested, SRT-specialized)
- [X] Maintain `SSAFileHandler` for custom handling of tags and metadata
- [X] Implement `VttFileHandler` for WebVTT (common web format) using native parser
- [X] Support speaker diarization metadata preservation from transcription workflows
- [X] Capture advanced VTT features as pass-through metadata
- [X] Export in VTT format maintaining compliance with WebVTT standards

**Acceptance Tests**:
- [X] Maintain existing SRT parsing with current `srt` module
- [X] Maintain existing SSA/ASS parsing with current `SSAFileHandler`
- [X] Parse WebVTT files with WEBVTT header and cue settings
- [X] Preserve speaker identification metadata from voice tags
- [X] Handle cue settings (position, align, size, line, vertical) as pass-through metadata
- [X] Preserve STYLE blocks in file metadata
- [X] Support cue identifiers and multi-line cues
- [X] Handle UTF-8 BOM in VTT files
- [X] Round-trip preservation of all VTT-specific features
- [X] Test format conversion between SRT, SSA, and VTT formats

**Files Created**:
- [X] `PySubtitle/Formats/VttFileHandler.py` (native implementation)
- [X] `PySubtitle/UnitTests/test_VttFileHandler.py`

**Implementation Outcome**:
After research into WebVTT we chose a **native parser approach** over pysubs2 integration for VTT:

- **Translation Focus**: We are focussed on translation, not format conversion.
- **Metadata Pass-Through**: Advanced features (cue settings, STYLE blocks, voice tags) captured as structured metadata and can be restored as-was in the translation.
- **Avoid Complexity**: pysubs2 conversion to SSA-like format adds complexity when VTT format is already close to internal representation
- **Future-ready**: Speaker metadata ready for transcription workflows

Native `VttFileHandler` successfully demonstrates the "keep it simple" approach while capturing sophisticated WebVTT metadata. The handler supports everything from basic subtitles to broadcast-quality WebVTT with positioning, styling, and speaker identification.

### Phase 8: GUI Integration
**Requirements**:
- Add format-specific settings to a new tab `SettingsDialog`, data-driven and extensible by registered handlers (similar to provider settings)

**Acceptance Tests**:
- [ ] Format-specific settings exposed in SettingsDialog

**Files to Modify**:
- SettingsDialog for format-specific options
- SubtitleFileHandler for format-specific options

## Technical Specifications

### SubtitleFormatRegistry API
```python
class SubtitleFormatRegistry:
    @classmethod
    def get_handler_by_extension(cls, extension: str) -> type[SubtitleFileHandler]
    
    @classmethod
    def create_handler(cls, extension: str|None, filename: str|None) -> SubtitleFileHandler
    
    @classmethod
    def enumerate_formats(cls) -> list[str]
    
    @classmethod
    def register_handler(cls, handler_class: type[SubtitleFileHandler]) -> None
    
    @classmethod
    def discover(cls) -> None
    
    @classmethod
    def disable_autodiscovery(cls) -> None
    
    @classmethod
    def clear(cls) -> None
    
    # Future API extensions:
    @staticmethod
    def detect_format_from_extension(filepath: str) -> str
    
    @staticmethod
    def detect_format_from_content(content: str) -> str
```

### Data-Driven Handler Architecture

**SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS Class Variable**:
SubtitleFileHandler uses a declarative approach for defining supported formats and their priorities:

```python
class ExampleFileHandler(SubtitleFileHandler):
    SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = {
        '.example': 10,  # High priority (specialist handler)
        '.alt': 5        # Medium priority (secondary support)
    }
    
    # Base class automatically implements:
    # - get_file_extensions() -> list[str] 
    # - get_extension_priorities() -> dict[str, int]
```

**Priority Convention**:
- **10+**: Primary/specialist handlers (e.g., `SrtFileHandler` for `.srt` = 10)
- **1-9**: Generic/multi-format handlers with lower precedence
- **0**: Fallback handlers used when no specialist implementation exists

### Extended SubtitleLine Metadata Schema
```python
# SSA Format Metadata
{
    "style": "Default",
    "layer": 0,
    "margin_l": 0,
    "margin_r": 0,
    "margin_v": 0,
    "effect": "",
    "override_codes": "{\\i1}italic text{\\i0}"
}

# WebVTT Format Metadata (Line-level)
{
    "cue_id": "subtitle-001",
    "vtt_settings": "position:10%,line-left align:left size:35%",
    "speaker": "Mary"
}
```

#### File-Level Metadata Storage
File handlers must capture and preserve format-specific file context, e.g.

```python
# SSA File Metadata
{
    "format": "ass",
    "script_info": {"Title": "Movie", "ScriptType": "v4.00+", ...},
    "styles": {"Default": {...}, "Italics": {...}},
    "original_pysubs2_file": SSAFile  # For perfect round-trip
}

# WebVTT File Metadata  
{
    "header_text": "WEBVTT", 
    "vtt_styles": [
        "::cue {\n  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, dimgray, lightgray);\n  color: papayawhip;\n}",
        "::cue(b) {\n  color: peachpuff;\n}"
    ]
}
```

### File Handler Requirements
All format handlers must:
1. Inherit from `SubtitleFileHandler`
2. Implement all abstract methods
3. Return unique indices for all subtitle lines
4. Store format-specific data in `SubtitleLine.metadata`
5. Handle format conversion gracefully
6. Include comprehensive error handling
7. Support both file and string input/output

### Unique Index Assignment Strategy
For formats that don't have native indices (like SSA):
- Sequential numbering starting from 1
- Preserve original event order
- Handle missing/duplicate indices by reassignment
- Maintain consistency across parse/compose cycles

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Breaking Changes**: Modifications to core `Subtitles` class could break existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive regression testing, backward compatibility preservation
- **Performance Impact**: Format detection could slow file loading
  - **Mitigation**: Measure and respond

### Medium Risk
- **Format Complexity**: SSA format has many advanced features that could be difficult to implement
  - **Mitigation**: Phased implementation, focus on common use cases first
- **Metadata Loss**: Converting between formats could lose format-specific information
  - **Mitigation**: Preserve and convert metadata as much as possible, but format conversion is not a priority focus for the app.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Format registry functionality
- Each file handler implementation
- Format detection algorithms
- Metadata preservation
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end file loading/saving

## pysubs2 Integration Architecture

All pysubs2-based handlers follow the pattern from `SSAFileHandler` (TODO: extract commonalities into a helper or base class)

- **Format-Specific Handlers**: Maintain separate handler classes for each format to enable format-specific optimizations
- **pysubs2 Foundation**: Leverage pysubs2's robust parsing and composition engines
- **Metadata Pass-Through**: Preserve all format-specific metadata for round-trip fidelity
- **Translation Focus**: Optimize for subtitle translation workflow while maintaining format integrity

### Metadata Strategy
- **Standard Fields**: Common subtitle properties (timing, text, style, layer)
- **Format-Specific**: Preserve format-unique properties in structured metadata
- **Round-Trip Preservation**: Store original pysubs2 object data in `_pysubs2_original`
- **Translation-Friendly**: Basic inline formatting (bold, italic) accessible to translators as SRT/HTML style tags

## Future Development considerations: Transcription + Translation Workflow

### Audio Transcription Integration
**Vision**: Extend LLM-Subtrans to support audio-to-subtitle-to-translation workflows, leveraging the format-agnostic architecture to handle diverse transcription outputs.

#### Phase A: OpenAI Whisper Integration
- Add audio file support (mp3, mp4, wav, webm, m4a)
- Integrate OpenAI Whisper API or local Whisper models
- Support timestamp-accurate transcription output
- Handle multiple languages with automatic detection

#### Phase B: Speaker Diarization Support
- Integrate WhisperX or Whisper+PyAnnote for speaker identification
- Store speaker information in `SubtitleLine.metadata`
- Support multi-speaker subtitle generation
- Enable speaker-based translation customization

#### Phase C: Advanced Transcription Features
- **Gemini Audio Processing**: Support for Google Gemini's multimodal audio transcription
- **Batch Audio Processing**: Process multiple audio files with consistent speaker identification

### Format-Specific Transcription Outputs
The multi-format architecture naturally supports transcription service outputs:
- **Whisper → SRT/VTT**: Standard timestamped transcription
- **Diarized Output → ASS**: Speaker-based styling and positioning  
- **Broadcast Content → SCC**: CEA-608/708 compliant captions
- **Streaming Services → TTML**: Advanced styling for platform requirements

### Enhanced Metadata Schema for Transcription
```python
# Speaker Diarization Metadata
{
    "transcription_source": "whisper_diarized",
    "speaker_id": "SPEAKER_00",
    "confidence_score": 0.95,
    "audio_segment": {"start": 12.34, "end": 18.67},
    "language_detected": "en",
}
```
### Integration Benefits
- **Single Tool Workflow**: Audio → Transcription → Translation → Formatted Output
- **Format Flexibility**: Choose optimal format for target platform (broadcast, web, mobile)
- **Speaker Context**: Leverage speaker information for more accurate translation
- **Quality Control**: Maintain transcription metadata for review and correction
